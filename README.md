Materials for programming assignment of Coursera Data Science

The materials in this repository include R code to clean up published Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer data. In addition, there is a codebook to understand the variables and format of the output data set. 

First, download the data at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

A full description of this data set can be found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

To run this code, run_analysis.R, first set the working directory to the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory in the unzipped data download. The code should not require the installation of any additional packages beyond the R base and standard installation packages. Output is a space delimited text file named "tidydata.txt". It contains a 180 row x 67 column data set of mean values for a suite of accelerometer variables.

Read the codebook, codebook.txt, for a full explanation of outputs.
