The tidy data set in tidydata.txt contains 180 rows and 67 columns. Each row corresponds
to a study subject and activity pairing, labeled accordingly in column 1, "subject/activity". 
There were 30 subjects, numbered ordinally, and six activities that each subject 
performed. The six activities are:

STANDING
SITTING 
LAYING
WALKING 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
WALKING_UPSTAIRS

Hence, the row labeled 9.SITTING corresponds to subject 9's accelerometer data
for sitting.

As stated above, column 1, "subject/activity" refers to the subject/activity 
pairing. Columns 2-67 correspond to 66 different variables of accelerometer data 
collected in the study data. Variable data have been averaged for each subject/activity
pair, including both testing and training data. Per the authors of the original data set:

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency 
of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration 
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated 
using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate 
frequency domain signals)."

Measured signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. Units are m/s^2.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

From these signals mean [mean()] and standard deviation [std()] were calculated.
For example, column 3, "2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
corresponds to mean values of tBodyAcc in the Y direction.
